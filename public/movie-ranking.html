<h2>My top 3 movies of all time!</h2>

<hr>
<h3>Lord of the rings</h3>
<p>I like the fantasy and all the action of the movie</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>I like the feeling of uncertainty the
    movie portrays and the concept of time relativity.</p>

<h3>Joker - 2019</h3>
<p>It was interesting to see what can happen to
    a man who dwells enough.</p>
